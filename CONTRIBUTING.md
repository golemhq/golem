# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the project! Golem is currently being actively developed and it needs all the help it can get. Your contribution is welcomed


## Bug Reports

When reporting new bugs, please make sure that the report includes the following information:

- OS name and version
- Python version
- Golem version
- Selenium version (if needed)
- Webdriver version (if needed)
- Browser version (if needed)
- Concise steps to reproduce the problem
- Screenshots or traceback of the error
- Any other data that could help find the origin of the problem.


PLEASE NOTE, because Golem uses the Python Selenium library, it is possible that bugs occur that are caused by the Python Selenium library, the webdriver executables or the browsers themselves. Always try using latest version of Selenium, the Webdriver executables and browsers when possible.

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributing code

If you have improvements or fixes for Golem, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the
[issues with the "contributions welcome" label](https://github.com/lucianopuccio/golem/labels/stat%3Acontributions%20welcome).
These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside
contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you
decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it.
